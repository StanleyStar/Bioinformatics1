# Create a list
mylist = ['A', 'T', 'C', 'G']

# Create an empty list
emptylist = []

# Create list with subsequences
subsequences = ['TTA', 'GCTAAG', 'GATTA']

# Convert string to list
string = 'ATCGA'

print(stringtolist)

# Find number of elements in the list
listlength = len(mylist)
print(listlength)

# Add new elements to the list

# Notice that here we don't need to assign to a variable

# Let's look at indexing and slicing
# Find the first member (element) of the list
first_member = mylist[0]

# Sorting a list NB: Sorting a list changes the original list object
mylist.sort()
print(mylist)

# Reverse the list
mylist.reverse()
print(mylist)

# Insert the codon "TTA" into the first position of the list
mylist.insert(0, "TTA")
print(mylist)

# Delete items from the list
# Approach 1 - by indexing
# Delete item in the 1st position
del mylist[0]
print(mylist)

# Approach 2 - by item value
# Let's delete GT
mylist.remove("GT")
print(mylist)
# Note that if we have several GT in this list, it'll only delete the first one

# To change an item
# Change T to GGT
mylist[0]="GGT"
print(mylist)

# Convert list to string
list_to_string = "".join(mylist)
print(list_to_string)
# This only works when all the list objects are strings
